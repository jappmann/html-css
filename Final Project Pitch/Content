    <h1>The Craft Corner</h1>
    <h2>Final Product</h1>
    <p>The Craft Corner will be an online platform for The Craft Corner company.
    The website has a dual purpose: For one, it will serve as a hub for all the crafts we as a team have compiled, created and come to love.
    This part of the website will be for interested crafters to find a project that is fit for them.
    The second purpose of the website is to connect with potential customers and will allow interested parties to contact our team and request our services for events.
    This part of the website allows us to reach an audience looking for an experienced crafter to come in and lead a project.
    </p>
    <h2>Website Details</h2>
    <p>The platform will be a website where crafters can navigate the many crafts compiled and created by us (the founders of the company) through tabs like DIY Crafts, Seasonal Crafts, Crafts by Mood, and Crafts for Age Groups.
    The idea behind these categories is to make it easier for crafters as well as create a personalized experience, catered towards each individual crafter.
    The website will also include monthly featured crafts that are explained through a video tutorial.
    An extension of the Featured Craft of the Month could be that crafters who attempt the featured craft can submit pictures of their final project to be voted on by a combination of us, the creators, and other crafters on the best attempt at the craft.
    This will create a more conversational approach with browsers, connecting crafters to each other and to us, the creators of the platform.
    I mentioned in the above section that we as a company, send experienced crafters to lead crafts at different events such as birthday parties and summer camps..
    We will also participate in pop-up art festivals to expose our company.
